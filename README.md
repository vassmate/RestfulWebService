# RestfulWebService
Repository for a restful web service exercise

# Used resources:

- Apache Maven
- Spring MVC
- Basic example: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/
- How to enable Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS): https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/

Enabling CORS is needed because it prevents the "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present..." 
error in the browsers.
